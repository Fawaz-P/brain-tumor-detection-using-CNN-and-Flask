# brain-tumor-detection-using-CNN-and-Flask
Brain tumors are a complex and life-threatening condition that requires accurate and timely diagnosis for effective treatment. With advancements in technology, deep learning and image processing techniques have emerged as powerful tools in medical image analysis, offering the potential to improve brain tumor detection. This project aims to develop an advanced brain tumor detection system that integrates these techniques, assisting medical professionals in early diagnosis and enhancing patient care.

The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly web-based platform for automated brain tumor detection. The system leverages the Flask web framework to provide an intuitive interface, allowing users to upload brain MRI images for analysis. To enhance image quality and highlight potential tumor regions, various preprocessing techniques such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, thresholding, and contour extraction are applied. These steps enable the system to extract relevant features and identify areas of interest in the brain images.

# DATASET
For the implementation of the project, a dataset of MRI images was utilized. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.com developed by Ahmed Hamada in 2020 for his brain tumor detection project. The dataset consists of a total of 3,000 MRI images, with 1,500 samples labeled as tumor-positive and the remaining 1,500 labeled as tumor-negative.
